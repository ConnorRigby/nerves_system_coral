### Getting started

The IOT-GATE-IMX8PLUS gateway expects the bootloader to be located on hardware BOOT partition 1. When flashing firmware, ensure that both the bootloader and a complete disk image, generated using the fwup CLI tool, are provided.

#### Prerequisites

- [NXP mfgtools](https://github.com/nxp-imx/mfgtools)
- [fwup](https://github.com/fwup-home/fwup)

#### Building a firmware image

```
fwup -a \
  -d $FW_PROJECT_DIR/_build/$TARGET/nerves/images/firmware.img \
  -i $FW_PROJECT_DIR/_build/$TARGET/nerves/images/firmware.fw  \
  -t complete
```

#### Flashing the firmware image

```
uuu \
  -b emmc_all \
  $BINARIES_DIR/imx8-boot-sd.bin \
  $FW_PROJECT_DIR/_build/$TARGET/nerves/images/firmware.img
```

#### Flashing only U-Boot

```
uuu -b emmc $BINARIES_DIR/imx8-boot-sd.bin
```
